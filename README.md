# Unreal Engine 4 VR Advanced Starter Project READ ME

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [Learn Unreal VR Nanodegree Foundation Program](https://www.udacity.com)

This is your first chance to build an Unreal VR experience based around locomotion. You’ll create a find-the-object style of game, create a set of blueprints that randomly hides an object, and develop a locomotion method that allows you to move around the apartment so that you can find the object.   


## Necessary Software
- [Epic Games Launcher, Unreal Engine 4.14 or 4.15](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog)
- [SteamVR](http://store.steampowered.com/steamvr) OR [Oculus Home](https://www.oculus.com/setup/)

## New To Github?

Github is one of the best ways for software developers to store their code and easily make changes that are then tracked and easily shareable with your team of developers. If you would like to learn more about Github, Udacity offers [a free course on how to use Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).
